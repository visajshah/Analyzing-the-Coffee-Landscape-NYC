\section{Problem Statement}
{Analyze neighborhood clusters of New York City (NYC), USA and Toronto, Canada based on the number of coffeehouses and cafes present and the ratings of the stores.}
\subsection{Purpose}
{NYC and Toronto are financial capitals of their respective countries, popular tourist destinations, have a huge population, and house offices of important international institutions and major corporate headquarters. In such a landscape, coffeehouses are a crucial part of everyday life. People socialize in coffee shops, hold informal group meetings, relax after a long day, and so on. Hence, it is imperative to analyze the coffee scene in such metros where millions depend on a cup of fresh brew.}
\subsection{Target Audience}
{The results of this study will be of particular interest to the major stakeholders mentioned below:-}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Major Coffeehouse and Cafe Chains}\\{Corporate chains working in this field can use the results to predict the market opportunities and future growth for their firm. This study will help them select the most profitable next new location.}
    \item \textbf{Prospective Franchisees and Coffeehouse Owners}\\{People wanting to buy franchise stores of chains, like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and so on, can understand the landscape and spread of quality stores. This will help them enter the market in a profitable manner with an idea of the competition and target customers.}

    \item \textbf{Offices and Public Places}\\{Corporate offices, especially small and medium businesses, need to ensure that their business location is attractive enough to be inviting to customers. Employees and visitors should know the options of going outside for informal meetings, relaxing, and so on.}
    \item \textbf{Tourists and Residents}\\{Tourism is a substantial part of the economy of both the cities. There is a constant and large influx of tourists who visit this city. This project can help the tourists make an informed choice about deciding where to enjoy a cup of refreshing coffee. Similarly, people new to the city or neighborhood can understand the surrounding coffee scene better.}
